# Game
A basic javascript game I developed while learning the language. Not much but it helped me enormously to learn the language.
It was given as a test to an online course. 

The instructions are simple: Click the shape appearing on your screen as fast as possible. 
The game contains the best score value and randomness in time of arrival of the next shape(only square and circle), color and sizes.
